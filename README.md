# Commit Viewer

Commit Viewer is a full-stack project that uses GitHub's API to show commits. It uses technologies such as Docker, React, Django, GraphQL, relay and redux.

## Installation

You need to have [Docker installed](https://www.docker.com/get-started).  
Then, clone this repo and just run:

#### Windows:

```bash
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

#### Linux:

```bash
sudo docker-compose build
sudo docker-compose up
```

## Usage

This project shows both backend and frontend. As such, you may go to:

- [http://localhost:8000/graphql/](http://localhost:8000/graphql/) to test the backend.
- [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to test the frontend.

Granted, the frontend project also consumes the backend, so you can test both there.
